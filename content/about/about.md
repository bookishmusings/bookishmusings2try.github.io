## Hello! :wave: 

my name is A (she/her :rainbow_flag:). I'm a PhD student living in SoCal. I'm in my late twenties (:older_woman:), blogging about reading, books, and other things I think about. I've been blogging on and off since I was about 16 (when I first discovered what blogging is) and I've been  *extremely online* ever since. You'll find my reading journey here.

**fun fact**: 
when i was about 23, i started watching a *lot* of booktube and increased the amount i read drastically. you could say i was ~influenced~ to buy a kindle too. now i read an unhealthy amount. noone should be reading this much. anyway, i wanted to keep a lofty goal for myself. before i turn thirty, i wanted to read 1000 books. i *just* finished doing that a few months ago, so i'm goalless for the near future. 
let me tell you one thing: those rich people are lying to you. you'll never be rich reading. 

**what genres do i read?**

i read pretty widely. i love me a cozy romance when my brain feels like a mush. i'm never known to say no to a pop sci book. i've been super into business/management books these days- the kind that brings social science/humanities perspective to how a brand was built has been my jam!!! i also love literary fic and translated works, especially if it's women-centric.

**what are my fav books?**
